                    Hello! I'm <strong>Tapos</strong>, a software engineer who enjoys building things that blend technology, research, and real-world impact.
                    My journey began during my undergraduate studies in <strong>Computer Science & Engineering</strong> at Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, 
                    where I immersed myself in research, machine learning, and extensive course projects that honed both my analytical and programming skills.

                <p>
                    During my university years, I completed numerous hands-on projects ranging from algorithm implementation to early experiments in computer vision. 
                    I also co-authored one journal paper and three conference papers, which laid the foundation for my research-oriented approach to software development.

                    After graduation in 2017, I joined a healthcare-focused startup where I applied my research knowledge to build real-world tools for retinal pathology detection. 
                    I developed desktop applications using <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>OpenCV</strong>, and <strong>Qt5</strong>, working on tasks such as retinal vessel segmentation, 
                    optic disc localization, and AMD stage detection.

                    In 2019, I moved to <strong>BrainCraft Ltd.</strong>, where my career expanded into mobile development. I began in the R&D team, creating 
                    <strong>real-time image processing components</strong> for mobile using <strong>OpenGL ES</strong> and <strong>Metal</strong>, then transitioned 
                    into app development for both Android and iOS. I've since contributed as a core developer to several widely used mobile apps.

                <p>
                    Over the years, I've continued refining my skills in native app development, computer vision, and machine learning, with a special interest in 
                    optimizing ML models for real-time and mobile environments. My current focus areas include:
